    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Get answers to common questions about our indexing service",
    "q1": {
      "question": "How exactly does Auto Submit Site work?",
      "answer": "Auto Submit Site uses a combination of APIs and specialized algorithms to submit your webpages directly to Google's indexing system. We leverage both the \"site:\" operator method and direct submission via Google Search Console API to ensure maximum coverage and speed."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How quickly will my content be indexed?",
      "answer": "Most submitted URLs are indexed within 24-48 hours, compared to 1-4 weeks for natural crawling. However, indexing speed may vary depending on your site's authority and content quality. Our data shows an average 5x improvement in indexing time."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Do I need technical knowledge to use this?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Our user-friendly dashboard makes it easy to submit and monitor your URLs with just a few clicks. Simply paste your URLs or connect your sitemap, and our system handles the rest. No coding or SEO expertise required."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How is this different from manually submitting URLs?",
      "answer": "Manual submission is time-consuming and limited. Our automated approach allows you to submit thousands of URLs on a scheduled basis, tracks indexing status, and uses multiple submission methods to maximize success rates."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Will this help my SEO and rankings?",
      "answer": "Faster indexing doesn't directly improve rankings, but it ensures your content appears in search results sooner. This means you can start gaining traffic and building engagement metrics faster, indirectly supporting your SEO efforts."
